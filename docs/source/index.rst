Zennit Documentation
====================

Zennit (Zennit Explains Neural Networks in Torch) is a python framework using PyTorch to compute local attributions in the sense of eXplainable AI (XAI) with a focus on Layerwise Relevance Progagation.
It works by defining *rules* which are used to overwrite the gradient of PyTorch modules in PyTorch's auto-differentiation engine.
Rules are mapped to layers with *composites*, which contain directions to compute the attributions of a full model, which maps rules to modules based on their properties and context.

Zennit is available on PyPI and may be installed using:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install zennit
