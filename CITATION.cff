  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be strong
  predictors, but their prediction strategies can rarely be
  understood. With recent advances in Explainable Artificial
  Intelligence (XAI), approaches are available to explore
  the reasoning behind those complex models' predictions.
  Among post-hoc attribution methods, Layer-wise Relevance
  Propagation (LRP) shows high performance. For deeper
  quantitative analysis, manual approaches exist, but
  without the right tools they are unnecessarily labor
  intensive. In this software paper, we introduce three
  software packages targeted at scientists to explore model
  reasoning using attribution approaches and beyond: (1)
  Zennit - a highly customizable and intuitive attribution
  framework implementing LRP and related approaches in
  PyTorch, (2) CoRelAy - a framework to easily and quickly
  construct quantitative analysis pipelines for dataset-wide
  analyses of explanations, and (3) ViRelAy - a
  web-application to interactively explore data,
  attributions, and analysis results. With this, we provide
  a standardized implementation solution for XAI, to
  contribute towards more reproducibility in our field.
