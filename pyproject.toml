# The project's basic metadata and dependencies
[project]

# General project information, the Project supports Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13; the version of the project is automatically determined from the
# latest Git tag using the Hatch-VCS plugin and the read me is dynamically generated using the Hatch Fancy PyPI Readme plugin (this  is necessary,
# because Hatch cannot access the root directory of the repository while building the wheel, which is where the read me is located; Hatch first builds
# the source distribution from the files in the project directory, from where it can access top-level repository files, and then builds the wheel from
# the source distribution by extracting it into a temporary directory, from where it cannot access the top-level repository files)
